# CerebralPalsyResearchFoundation
Collaborated project to integrate a switch mechanism. This switch will enable our client with level V Cerebral Palsy to gain a greater level of independence by allowing him/her to switch to and from three different states. These states are a communication function, seat adjustment function, and mobility function.
